# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Gui-Center is a French real estate platform ("Plateforme Immobili√®re Moderne") built with Next.js 13.5.1, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The application allows users to browse, search, and filter property listings for both sale and rental.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server (Next.js)
npm run build        # Build for production (static export)
npm start           # Start production server
npm run lint        # Run ESLint

# No test scripts are currently configured
```

## Architecture & Structure

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 13.5.1 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.2.2
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.3.3 with custom design system
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom shadcn/ui components
- **Maps**: Leaflet with react-leaflet
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **State Management**: React Context (AuthProvider)
- **Icons**: Lucide React

### Key Directory Structure
- `app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `components/` - Reusable UI components organized by feature
  - `ui/` - Base shadcn/ui components
  - `layout/` - Header, Footer, navigation components
  - `properties/` - Property-specific components
  - `maps/` - Map-related components
  - `providers/` - Context providers
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `lib/` - Utility functions and validations

### Important Patterns

**Component Organization**: Components follow shadcn/ui patterns with Tailwind CSS. The design system uses CSS custom properties for theming.

**Data Handling**: Currently uses mock data in `useProperties` hook. All property data is client-side with simulated API delays.

**Authentication**: Context-based auth system via `AuthProvider` and `useAuth` hook.

**Routing**: Uses Next.js App Router with French locale (`lang="fr"`).

**Styling**: Custom Tailwind config with extended color palette using CSS variables. Components use `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` for conditional classes.

### Configuration Notes
- **Static Export**: Configured for static export (`output: 'export'`)
- **Images**: Unoptimized images due to static export
- **ESLint**: Ignores builds (`ignoreDuringBuilds: true`)
- **Path Aliases**: Uses `@/*` for root-level imports

### Data Models
Key interfaces defined in `types/index.ts`:
- `Property` - Core property data with address, features, photos
- `User` - User accounts with roles (admin/seller/buyer)  
- `SearchFilters` - Property search and filtering
- `VisitRequest` - Property viewing requests

### Mock Data
Currently uses hardcoded mock properties in `hooks/useProperties.ts` with sample listings for Paris and Lyon.
